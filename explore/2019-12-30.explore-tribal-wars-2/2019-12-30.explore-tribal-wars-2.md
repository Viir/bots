# 2019-12-30 Explore Tribal Wars 2

The goal is to find a better process to farm barbarian villages in Tribal Wars 2. Older approaches are limited by the bug in the games user interface: https://forum.botengine.org/t/farm-manager-tribal-wars-2-farmbot/1406/209?u=viir

Last ideas to implement the automation:

> Seeing this screenshot, I remembered more details about the game:  
> As far as I remember, there was some way to open the village context menu for given coordinates. If this (still) exists we could even scan all coordinates around your villages to search for barbarians. We could enumerate all possible coordinates in a given radius from your villages, ordered by distance, and try to open the village menu for these.  
>  
> Then we would not need the reports anymore to learn the coordinates of villages. Then the bugs in the report list UI would not anymore limit the bot.  
>  
> If we can find a way to open the list seen in the screenshot, we could speed up this scanning process by filtering out some of the coordinates earlier.  
>  
> About distinguishing between barbarians and other:  
> The formular to send an army might look different if there is a player owning the destination village.

Open chrome devtools. In the 'Elements' panel, find an element like this:

```HTML
<div id="map" role="main" tabindex="1" ng-controller="MapController" ng-class="{running: isInitialized}" class="running"> <div ng-embedded-include="true">
[...]
```

Get the `MapController` in the chrome devtools console:

```javascript
angular.element(document.getElementById('map')).controller()
```

Now we can jump to coordinates on the map:

```javascript
angular.element(document.getElementById('map')).controller().jumpTo(494,502)
```

But, using the approach above, the context menu does not open, even if there is a village at that location.

Maybe it is easier to stay close to the UI, open the map by clicking on this element:

```HTML
<a id="world-map" href="#" ng-click="toggleWorldMapSearch($event)" class="btn-orange icon-44x44-view-worldmap" tooltip="" tooltip-content="Busca en el Mapa Mundial" internal-id="52"></a>
```

```javascript
document.getElementById('world-map').click()
```

A new element appears:

```HTML
<div id="world-map-search-wrapper" world-map-search=""><div id="world-map-search-0xc" class="directive-world-map-search box-border-dark box-wrapper visible"> <div> <table 
[...]
```

Looking closer into the javascript related to that part of the UI, find this interesting part:

```javascript
define('directives/WorldMapSearchDirective',['app', 'battlecat', 'conf/conf', 'helper/dom', 'helper/parse', 'generators/generate'],
	function(app, $, conf, domHelper, parseHelper, generate) {
	app.directive('worldMapSearch', ['$rootScope', 'eventTypeProvider', 'linkService', '$filter', 'mapService', 'storageService', 'modelDataService', 'autoCompleteService',
		function($rootScope, eventTypeProvider, linkService, $filter, mapService, storageService, modelDataService, autoCompleteService) {
		var textObject = 'directive_world_map';

[...]

					/**
					 * Uses some events to jump on the specified coordinates.
					 *
					 * @param {Object} item item to jump to
					 */
					jumpTo = function jumpTo(item) {
						validateCoordinates(item);

						if (item.type === 'village') {
							mapService.jumpToVillage(item.x, item.y, item.id);
						} else {
							autoCompleteService.villageByCoordinates(item, function(data) {
								mapService.jumpToVillage(item.x, item.y, data.id);
							});
						}
					},
```

Seems that is the `jumpTo` that is used in the world map search. If we could get references to `autoCompleteService` and `mapService`, then maybe we can use these without depending on clicks.

Get the services:

```javascript
autoCompleteService = angular.element(document.body).injector().get('autoCompleteService')
mapService = angular.element(document.body).injector().get('mapService')
```

Now we can build a function to jump to coordinates and also open the menu if a village is there:

```javascript
jumpTo = function jumpTo(item) {
        autoCompleteService.villageByCoordinates(item, function(data) {
            mapService.jumpToVillage(item.x, item.y, data.id);
        });
}
```

And use it like this:

```javascript
jumpTo({x:501,y:501})
```
