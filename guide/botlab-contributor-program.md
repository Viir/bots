# BotLab Contributor Program

We created the BotLab Contributor Program to recognize and reward the hard work of our awesome contributors, encourage knowledge sharing within the developer community, and build friendly competition around contributions.

Through the contributor program, contributors are rewarded with BotLab credits and can use the [BotLab 'Pro' features](https://botlab.org/pricing) for free.

## How it works

Earn credits by recording videos, writing content, collecting training data, contributing code, answering technical questions, or validating others' contributions.

## Automatic rewards for bot programs

Besides the manual distribution of rewards, there are automatic rewards for sharing bot programs.
Through automated rewards, authors earn credits proportional to the popularity of their publications.

After publishing a new bot program under their name, the contributor receives 20 % of all credits spent with that bot. For each 500 thousand credits users pay for running that bot, the contributor gets 100 thousand credits.

To enable the automatic rewards, the contributor must publish their bot on the BotLab catalog under their name.

### Attribution and verification of authorship

To register as the author of a bot program, set the `authors-forum-usernames` tag in the bot program's `Bot.elm` file. If the bot has multiple names in `authors-forum-usernames`, the rewards will be split between these authors.
When publishing a bot on the catalog, ensure the list of authors does not contain a name without their consent since users tend to message the listed authors with support requests.
The listed authors receive the credits via a voucher code via a private message on the [BotLab forum](https://forum.botlab.org).
