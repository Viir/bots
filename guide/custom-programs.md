# Custom Programs

This file lists some of the customizations of bot programs found on the internet. Often these emerged from answering developers' questions.
The list serves as an additional way to find customizations again, besides the general [catalog](https://catalog.botlab.org).
If you think a change should be merged into the main branch, you can post on the [forum](https://forum.botlab.org) or create an issue on the [bots GitHub page](https://github.com/Viir/bots/issues).
The main branch of the example programs develops by evolution: The more popular a change with users, the more likely it will be merged into the main branch. You can see the popularity displayed at `Total running time in hours` on the program's catalog entry.
To find a program on the catalog, you can also enter the commit as a search term, or use the `botlab  describe` command.

## 2020-10-31 - Stephan Fuchs - EVE Online - Merged Mining Scripts

https://github.com/Viir/bots/commit/f6246764ac106894e74669815c0e675c48ab9262

Original discussion: https://forum.botlab.org/t/eve-online-request-suggestion/3663

```
Would it be possible to merge both mining scripts?
So that the normal mining script would use mining drones as well?
Currently the drones willl be activated, but they donâ€™t mine (I guess because most people are using them as fighting drones)
Thanks for your help and your great tools
```
